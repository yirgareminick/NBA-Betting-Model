# Notebooks Directory

This directory is for Jupyter notebooks used for:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data patterns and distributions
- **Model Experimentation**: Testing different algorithms and hyperparameters  
- **Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs for analysis
- **Prototyping**: Quick experiments before implementing in the main pipeline

## Guidelines

- Name notebooks descriptively: `01_data_exploration.ipynb`, `02_feature_analysis.ipynb`
- Include date in notebook names for experiments: `2024_07_07_model_comparison.ipynb`
- Document findings and conclusions in markdown cells
- Export important visualizations to the `docs/` directory

## Example Notebooks

- **Data Exploration**: Examine game data, team statistics, and betting odds
- **Feature Engineering**: Test new feature ideas and validate their effectiveness
- **Model Analysis**: Compare different algorithms, analyze feature importance
- **Performance Evaluation**: Backtesting, profit/loss analysis, Kelly criterion validation
